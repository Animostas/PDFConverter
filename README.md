# PDFConverter

Python script to convert .doc, .docx, and .tmd to .pdf

This requires the win32com module which is not in the default Python installation, and can be downloaded [here](http://starship.python.net/~skippy/win32/Downloads.html). To use this script, put it in a directory of files you want to convert, and then run it. It will create a new folder within the given directory called 'PDFs', and save all converted files there.

This was written in Python 3.5.1
